# Project Brief

## Name
Portfolio Maker

## Objective
Build a web app where a user signs in, uploads a resume, fills a form, and generates a personal portfolio site with selectable themes and a personal slug.

## Primary User Outcome
From zero content to a deployed personal portfolio URL in one guided flow.

## Constraints
- Prefer free-tier services.
- Use Google or GitHub auth (whichever is easiest to implement and maintain).
- Parse resume using an LLM API (Groq or OpenRouter) and enforce JSON output.
- Deploy to Vercel after verification.
